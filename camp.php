                            <p class="movie__option" align="justify"><strong>Mousuni is a small island of the Sunderban Delta. It's beauty lies in the confluence of the sea with the river. Made by the British for transportation of salt and dry fish, mousuni got it's name from the Bengali words, "mosh ani" means  "bringing buffalo". When British people come to inspect the place they find out nobody lives in these islands but lots of people come here everyday. When asked why they come here the locals responded, "mosh ani" i.e they bring their buffaloes here to feed and so goes the name Mousuni.
                            The mainstay economy of the people here is agriculture and fishing. However the severe impacts of climate change has its toll on the lives of people here who were already having a precarious existence.
                            Your stay at our backpackers camp is going to be an unique and exciting experience in itself. No this camp doesn't have the luxury of five star hotels, it have the luxury of billion stars, the luxury of the song of the sea and the music of the winds. Starting from fishing to beach cycling, from playing volleyball in the sand dunes to laying idly with your favourite book on the hammock or looking at the magical sky during sunrise or sunset for hours sitting at the gazebo, our camp has a whole bunch of exciting experiences to offer.
